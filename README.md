# Integrate Meta-analysis into Specific Study (InMASS)

This repository provides an **R implementation** of **InMASS**, as introduced in the pre-print paper:  
ðŸ“„ **[Integrate Meta-analysis into Specific Study (InMASS) for Estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21091)** 


## Repository Structure

- `01_simulation/`: Contains R scripts for conducting simulation studies.
- `02_case study/`: Contains R scripts and data for a case study.
- `propose_functions.R`: Defines the core functions used in the simulation and the case study.


## To use the core functions:

```
source("propose_functions.R")
```

## Example 
The Example of how to apply the proposed method can be found in the R scripts located in the `02_case study/` directory.
